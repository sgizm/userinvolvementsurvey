However, in most projects (designing and building applications for customers) we have little or no access to actual end users, and rely mostly on the expertise of other domain experts provided by the customer. The most typical contact we have with end users is conducting interviews over voice or video call, sometimes in combination with remote observation of usage. This lack of continuous direct contact regularly leads to bad design desicions simply due to insufifficent information on user needs.","3","","4","4","5","5","4","5","4","5","3","4","2","5","4","2","5","4","NA","4","1","2"
